    <h1>Mikko Project</h1>
    <p>
      Mikko is a web-based front-end project created to move beyond static pages
      and demonstrate how structured code, user-focused design, and interactivity
      come together in a functional web experience. The project reflects my
      transition from basic layouts to building complete, usable interfaces.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The situation behind Mikko was a common early developer challenge:
      understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript individually, but struggling to
      combine them into a cohesive project. The goal was to design and build a
      clean, responsive interface that feels intentional, interactive, and
      technically sound.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Responsive and interactive user interface</li>
      <li>Clear separation of structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and logic (JavaScript)</li>
      <li>Consistent layout optimized for different screen sizes</li>
      <li>Reusable components and readable code organization</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <div class="tech-stack">
      <div class="tech">HTML5</div>
      <div class="tech">CSS3</div>
      <div class="tech">JavaScript</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      To achieve this, I structured the project using semantic HTML to ensure
      clarity and accessibility. CSS was used to handle layout, responsiveness,
      and visual consistency, while JavaScript introduced interactivity and
      user-driven behavior. Throughout development, I focused on maintainability
      by keeping the code modular, readable, and logically organized.

    <h2>What I Learned & Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Building Mikko strengthened my understanding of how front-end technologies
      work together in real projects. More importantly, it changed how I approach
      development: starting from the user’s perspective, planning structure before
      styling, and treating interactivity as a core feature rather than an
      afterthought. This project increased my confidence in building complete
      interfaces independently and laid a strong foundation for more complex
      applications.
